## 📌 M.S. Thesis Project (In Progress)
**Topic:** Long-term Daily Solar Radiation Prediction  
Using past meteorological data (temperature, humidity, IR, wind, pressure, etc.), trend-based features, and hybrid ML models to estimate next-day solar radiation.  
**Tech Stack:** Deep Learning, Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LSTM

## 📌 [B.S. Capstone Project](https://github.com/mmbillah804/isrt-du/tree/main/bs-capstone-project)
**Topic:** Hourly Weather Forecasting Using Stacked Bi-directional LSTM  
Developed a deep learning model using stacked bi-directional LSTM layers to forecast hourly temperature (T2M) for the 7 days, based on the previous 7 days of multivariate weather data. The pipeline includes cyclic feature encoding, sliding window sequence generation, normalization, and time-series modeling with a focus on temporal dependencies and evaluation using RMSE.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, pandas, bi-directional LSTM, time-series modeling

## 🧠 Skills & Tools

**Languages:** Python, R, SQL  
**Libraries:** `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `TensorFlow`, `keras`, `nltk`, `e1071`, `tidyverse`  
**Concepts:** Statistical Inference, Predictive Modeling, Feature Engineering, Classification & Regression, Model Tuning  
**Tools:** VS Code, Jupyter, Git, Bash, PostgreSQL  
**Soft Skills:** Research writing, analytical thinking, communication, remote collaboration


### ☕ Fun Fact
I believe clean code, reproducible research, and real-world utility should go hand-in-hand. If a model can't be explained or deployed—it's not done yet.
